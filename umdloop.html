										<b>UMD Loop</b> is a competition team part of the University of Maryland. All our members are undergraduate students, and we take pride
										in balancing our studies with the work on this engineering team. We competed in the <b>Not-a-Boring Competition</b>, where
										we were tasked with digging a 100 feet long tunnel that is 2 feet in diameter. In the first-ever competition, we won the safety award
										for our outstanding systems analysis and verification to ensure safety of the team and the public. Currently, we are looking to make a 
										debut in the <b>University Rover Challenge</b> where we build a martian rover capable of navigating NASA's Mars Desert Research Station 
										in the deserts of Utah.

										I started as the responsible engineer for a material transfer assembly called the screw conveyor. With that role, I designed, analyzed, and assembled this conveyor. 
										The parts I designed came to fruition with detailed drawings and deliberation with machinists. As time progressed and members started 
										graduating, I was involved in other sub-assemblies, namely the transmission and excavation tools. These last two items were in dire needs
										of development as the competition was drawing near. During major crunch time, my team and I completed and assembled the excavation 
										sub-assembly while learning valuable experience in tolerances and hands-on assembling.

										The screw conveyor was an engineering trial from the beginning. Having no prior knowledge in material transfer systems and conveyors, I sought out
										governing equations for screw conveyors to optimize the screw conveyor sizing for our needs.

									<p>
										Going into the second Not-a-Boring Competition, I was the lead engineer for the excavation subteam. I wanted to share my experience
										and skillset learned from the first competition to new members while also expanding upon them in the second competition. It was a learning
										experience to transition from purely technical work to technical and systems level work. While still actively designing and analyzing,
										I had to put equal effort into planning requirements and logistics for the team to succeed, not just myself.
									</p>
									<p>
										I guided the subteam with setting relevant requirements based on our system's development. Delegating members to different tasks required the 
										facilitation of knowledge transfers from either myself or other core members of the team. I particularly transferred knowledge on modeling in
										NX 11, using finite element analysis on our new components, and knowing what loads acted on our components. While I opted for a hands off approach
										in distributing tasks, I still wanted to be involved in major design breakthroughs and back up our member's decisions
									</p>
									<h3 class="major">Drive and Propulsion Lead (February 2023 and Onward)</h3>
									<p>
										The team wanted to transition to a new competition called the University Rover Challenge after the Not-a-Boring Competition. Going into this
										newer competition, I strove to build upon my past experience as Excavation Lead and improved my communication among my members. There was also
										better motivation to compete in something new.
									</p>
									<p>
										This competition, we are focusing on simulating the motion and dynamics of our models first before investing time to building physical prototypes.
										For the Not-a-Boring Competitions, it was impractical to make full prototypes due to the size and cost of materials. Therefore, this time,
										I investigated the usage of multi-body dynamics (MBD) software and taught other members how to use it for our complex mechanisms. This software
										was particularly useful for the drivetrain team for narrowing down designs on suspension and propulsion requirements.
