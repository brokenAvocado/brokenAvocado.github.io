									<p>
										Also known as an auger, this was the primary method of transporting soil from the front of the tunnel boring machine to the rear. 
										This is to make way for more soil
										that will get excavated and have a continuous cycle of excavating and storing dirt. Because our soil has no treatment or water
										added, it will be very coarse and abrasive rock (based on the Las Vegas soil conditions).
									</p>
									<h3 class="major">Design Process</h3>
									<p>
										General dimensions of this auger were chosen from literature. The auger uses an archimedes screw with specific inner
										and outer diameters for the rock sizes and shapes we would be encountering. There were a lot of spacing and sizing issues with the 
										auger because it had to pass through many subsystems. Namely, the hydraulic fittings and motors and the steering joints 
										were all regularly changing and intefering during the design process. It require conveying the correct 
										auger length and angle to these responsible engineers.
									</p>
									<h3 class="major">Analysis</h3>
									<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/augerFEA.png" alt="" /></span></div>
									<p>
										Deflection on the auger bit itself was done to ensure it would not interfere with the casing. Additionally, the flights of the 
										screw portion were looked at for shear failure and bending stress.
									</p>
									<h3 class="major">Manufacturing</h3>
									<embed src="documents/auger.pdf" type="application/pdf" width="100%" height="600px" />
									<p>
										Welding and machining the steel components were done out of house, with drawings that had tolerances and instructions that were
										important to the functionality of the auger. The hardest weld to describe to manufacturers was the elliptical weld for the plate 
										that this whole assembly was mounted to. With a circular casing at an angle, the plate interfaced with the casing at an angle (because
										the plate is supposed to be flush with the mounting wall).  
									</p>
									<p>
										Tolerances on hole position were used the most. The screw portion of the 
										auger needed to be centered so it would not interfere with its circular housing, so a tolerance on the bearing location was 
										used. Additionally, radial patterns of fasteners shared tolerances so that, by the end, all fasteners could be mounted without 
										causing interference on their respective parts.
