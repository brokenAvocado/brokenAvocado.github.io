									<h3 class="major">What does the CORE Lab do?</h3>
									<p>
										The <a href = "http://www.core.umd.edu/">CORE Lab</a> is the University of Maryland's composites and smart structures laboratory.
										We investigate the structural behavior and stresses of novel materials and mechanisms, ranging from flexible lattice structures and 
										foams for impact resistance to pneumatic artificial muscles.
									</p>
									<p>
										In particular, I work with Frank Cianciarulo, an Aerospace Engineering graduate student, to characterize the behavior of pneumatic
										artificial muscles (PAMs). Once we pressurize these PAMs, they are able to exert axial and radial loads, and we measure the different 
										load capabilities and other metrics to understand these PAMs capabilities. These characterisitics are important for not only widening
										the understanding of PAMs in academia but also to contribute to design decisions for actuators on soft robots. Eventually these types
										of muscles will be able to burrow into the ground and explore subterranean environments on Earth, Mars, and more.
									</p>
									<h3 class="major">Undergraduate Research Experience</h3>
									<p>
										My project focuses around the PAM's torsional capabilities, which means how the PAM reacts the torsional loads when one end is fixed.
										Its stiffness against torsion is related to how much it is pressurized, and at multiple pressures, I was able to extrapolate the maximum 
										torque the muscle could react with a torisonal testing rig. Designing a rig that can output a controlled and consistent amount of torque
										was the challenge, and it also needed to measure various loads and displacements for research purposes.
									</p>
									<p>
										To get to the point of designing a testing rig, I needed to prove my design decisions. Using literature, I calculated the expect torque 
										a burrowing robot would experience in material ranging from sandy to icy. I also ensured the components on this test rig would not break 
										with stress calculations at key components and stress concentrations.
										
										Its stiffness against torsion is related to how much it is pressurized, and at multiple pressures, I was able to extrapolate the maximum 
										torque the muscle could react with a torisonal testing rig. The torsional rig parts were designed and analyzed to deliver the target torque to get useful data from the muscles. Additionally, 
										I needed to interface with an array of sensors for data collection,
										and I controlled the experiment with a large stepper motor. An arduino integrated all the electronics to a custom interface, which I had programmed 
										from scratch. All this was neededbecause the sensor suite was unique
