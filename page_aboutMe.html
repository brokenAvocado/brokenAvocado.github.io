									<h3 class="major">Education</h3>
									<p>
										I am a student at the University of Maryland, College Park majoring in Aerospace Engineering
										and minoring in Robotics and Autonomous Systems.
									</p>

									<h3 class="major">Why Engineering</h3>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/DSC00006.JPG" alt=""/></span>
										Ever since playing with LEGOS as a child, I knew I wanted to do hands-on work in my future career. Whether working outside or tinkering with something in the garage, I always love working with physical objects and seeing how assemblies come together. I got fascinated by structures and mechanisms in the real world, wondering why designers would add a specific feature or choose a specific material. This fascination helped motivate me to learn more through my structural mechanics and dynamics courses.									</p>
									</p>
									<p>
										Combining my hands-on and mechanical curiosity with a competitive nature, I dedicated myself to engineering teams throughout high school and college. Whether doing robotics or tunnel boring, we united under a common goal. It was inspiring how, as a team, we could do more than what one engineer could do by themselves.
									</p>
									<p>
										I enjoyed working late nights and racing against the clock. I knew I had to pull my weight to learn and improve as an engineer. The highs and lows were just part of the excitement of being part of a competition.
