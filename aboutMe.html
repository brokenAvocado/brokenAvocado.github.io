									<h3 class="major">Education</h3>
									<p>
										I am an Aerospace Engineering major with a minor in Robotics, and I am a student at the 
										University of Maryland, College Park. Initially, I was a mechanical engineering major,
										but after joining UMD Loop and being enthralled by the space industry and spacecraft, I
										could not resist switching majors.
									</p>

									<h3 class="major">Why Engineering</h3>
									<p>
										Ever since playing with Legos as a child, I was born to do hands-on work. Whether it is 
										working outside or tinkering with something in the garage, I always love working with
										physical objects and seeing how assemblies come together. I was always fascinted with
										real life structures and mechanisms, wondering why designers would add a specific feature
										here or chose a specific material. This would be especially motivational when I started learning
										about structural mechanics.
									</p>

									<p>
										This coincided with my competitive and perfectionist nature. I joined engineering teams all 
										throughout highschool and into college. Not only did I love my work with physically building 
										and designing, but I enjoyed the challenge and the grind the finish assembling robots or tunnel
										boring machines together. Spending late nights at the garage was a stressful experience, but the
										catharsis from finally finishing projects and the excitement of competing was really a joy.
									</p>

									<p>
										Explore through my experiences of being part of a competition team, research group, and many more.
									</p>
